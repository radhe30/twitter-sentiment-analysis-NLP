# twitter-sentiment-analysis-NLP
## Description
This project analyzes the sentiment of tweets using natural language processing (NLP). It uses a dataset containing 1.6 million tweets, labeled as positive or negative, to train a machine learning model. The goal is to classify the sentiment of tweets accurately, which can be useful for businesses, researchers, and developers looking to analyze public opinion.

#Dataset
The dataset contains 1.6 million labeled tweets, with the following columns:
- `target`: Sentiment label (0 = negative, 4 = positive).
- `text`: The tweet content.

- Evaluate model accuracy using precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Classify new tweets in real-time.
